# Phase 1.1: Email Collection Enforcement - COMPLETE

## Implementation Summary

Email collection is now **fully enforced** based on configured settings in the admin panel.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. BookingContext Extended
Added email tracking fields:
```typescript
interface BookingContext {
  // ... existing fields
  emailCollectionAsked?: boolean;  // Track if we asked for email
  contactEmail?: string;            // Cache contact's email
}
```

### 2. Email Collection Check Method
Created `checkEmailCollection(context, message)` that:

**Respects Configuration:**
- Loads `email_collection_mode` from BotConfigService
- Uses configured prompts (`email_collection_prompt_mandatory`, `email_collection_prompt_gentle`)
- Supports 3 modes: `mandatory`, `gentle`, `disabled`

**Smart Email Extraction:**
- Automatically extracts email from messages using regex
- Saves email to contacts table immediately
- Updates context to avoid re-asking

**Mode-Specific Behavior:**

**Disabled Mode:**
- Skips email collection entirely

**Gentle Mode:**
- Asks politely once with configured prompt
- Allows user to skip if they don't provide it
- Proceeds with booking even without email

**Mandatory Mode:**
- Uses mandatory prompt from config
- Blocks booking until email is provided
- Keeps asking until valid email received

### 3. Integration into Booking Flow
- Called in `handleNewBooking()` BEFORE booking proceeds
- Returns null if email collected or not required
- Returns prompt string if email needed
- Prevents booking completion in mandatory mode without email

## Example Flows

### Mandatory Mode
```
User: "I'd like to book an appointment"
Bot: [configured mandatory prompt]
     "To complete your booking, I'll need your email address for 
      confirmation and appointment reminders. Could you please share it?"

User: "I don't want to give my email"
Bot: "I still need your email address to complete the booking. 
     Could you please provide it? (e.g., yourname@example.com)"

User: "john@example.com"
Bot: ✅ Email collected → Proceeds with booking
```

### Gentle Mode
```
User: "I want to book a cleaning"
Bot: [configured gentle prompt]
     "By the way, could I have your email address? This helps us send
      you appointment confirmations and reminders. (It's okay if you'd
      prefer not to share it)"

User: "No thanks"
Bot: ✅ Proceeds with booking anyway (gentle mode allows skip)
```

### Disabled Mode
```
User: "Book me an appointment"
Bot: ✅ Proceeds directly to booking (no email asked)
```

## Technical Details

**Email Regex:** `/[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}/`

**Database Updates:**
- Saves email to `contacts.email` column
- Updates `contacts.updated_at` timestamp
- Logs extraction: `✅ Email collected from message: {email}`

**Context Management:**
- Caches email to avoid repeated database queries
- Tracks if prompt already shown (`emailCollectionAsked`)
- Prevents duplicate prompts in same conversation

## Configuration Integration

**Uses BotConfigService settings:**
- `email_collection_mode` → 'mandatory' | 'gentle' | 'disabled'
- `email_collection_prompt_mandatory` → Required prompt text
- `email_collection_prompt_gentle` → Polite ask prompt text

**Default Prompts (from BotConfigService):**
```typescript
email_collection_prompt_gentle: 
  'By the way, could I have your email address? This helps us send you 
   appointment confirmations and reminders. (It\'s okay if you\'d prefer 
   not to share it)'

email_collection_prompt_mandatory: 
  'To complete your booking, I\'ll need your email address for confirmation 
   and appointment reminders. Could you please share it?'
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Set mode to 'mandatory' → Bot blocks booking without email
- [ ] Provide email → Bot extracts and saves it
- [ ] Set mode to 'gentle' → Bot asks once, allows skip
- [ ] Skip in gentle mode → Booking proceeds without email
- [ ] Set mode to 'disabled' → Bot never asks for email
- [ ] Check email saved in contacts table
- [ ] Verify configured prompts are used (not hardcoded text)

## Impact

**Before:**
- Email collection ignored
- Bookings created without emails
- No confirmation emails sent
- Lost customer data

**After:**
- Email collection enforced based on configuration
- Mandatory mode ensures all bookings have emails
- Gentle mode improves customer experience
- Customizable prompts for branding/tone
- Automatic extraction from messages

✅ **Phase 1.1 COMPLETE**
