## üìä Database Schema Changes

**File:** `supabase-schema.sql` (already updated)

### New Tables (8):
- `promotions` - Discount campaigns with bot autonomy settings
- `promotion_usage` - Audit trail for all applied promotions
- `bot_discount_requests` - Admin approval queue for bot suggestions
- `payment_links` - Stripe checkout session tracking
- `csv_import_batches` - Bulk customer import history
- **Views:** `promotion_performance`, `bot_discount_analytics`
- **Triggers:** Auto-increment promotion usage, auto-expire old requests

### Updated Tables:
- `contacts`: Added `source`, `import_batch_id`, `notes`, `tags[]`
- `bookings`: Added `promotion_id`, `original_price_chf`, `final_price_chf`, `payment_link_sent`

---

## üîê Security Measures Implemented

### Balance Sheet Protection:
‚úÖ Bot autonomy capped at 20 CHF (configurable via `bot_max_autonomous_discount_chf`)  
‚úÖ Admin approval required for all discounts >20 CHF  
‚úÖ Customer lifetime value displayed before approval  
‚úÖ Usage limits prevent promotional abuse  
‚úÖ Comprehensive audit trail in `promotion_usage` table  

### Payment Security:
‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX**: Stripe webhook now requires signature verification  
‚úÖ Webhook secret must be configured (no fallback processing)  
‚úÖ Raw body buffer for proper signature validation  
‚úÖ All forged payment events rejected  

### Access Control:
‚úÖ Master role required for: promotion creation, bot approvals, CSV import  
‚úÖ Support role: read-only access to promotions and customers  
‚úÖ JWT authentication on all protected endpoints  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Schema

```bash
# In your local terminal (not Replit):
git add supabase-schema.sql DATABASE_SCHEMA_UPDATES.sql
git commit -m "feat: Complete promotion & payment system

- 8 new tables: promotions, payment_links, bot_discount_requests, etc.
- Updated contacts and bookings tables
- Production-safe Stripe webhook with signature verification
- Bot autonomy with admin approval queue
- CSV customer import functionality"

git push origin main
```

**Verify deployment:**
- GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab ‚Üí "Deploy to Supabase" workflow
- Wait for green checkmark ‚úì

---

### 2. Configure Stripe

**Required Settings (add via CRM ‚Üí Settings):**

```
stripe_api_key = sk_test_... (or sk_live_... for production)
stripe_webhook_secret = whsec_... (from Stripe Dashboard)
payments_enabled = true
```

**Stripe Dashboard Setup:**
1. Go to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/payments/webhook`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.*`, `payment_intent.*`
4. Copy webhook signing secret ‚Üí save as `stripe_webhook_secret` in Settings

---

### 3. Enable Bot Discount Automation

**Settings to configure:**
```
bot_discount_enabled = true
bot_max_autonomous_discount_chf = 20
bot_discount_sentiment_threshold = -0.3
bot_discount_inactive_days_threshold = 90
```

**How it works:**
- Bot offers ‚â§20 CHF autonomously for negative sentiment or 90+ days inactive
- Bot flags >20 CHF for admin approval (VIP customers, high-value retention)
- Admins see full context: sentiment, spending history, inactivity
- Approval creates time-limited promotion voucher

---

### 4. CSV Customer Import

**Format:** `phone_number` (required), `name`, `email`, `preferred_language`, `notes`, `tags`

**Example CSV:**
```csv
phone_number,name,email,preferred_language,notes,tags
+41791234567,Max M√ºller,max@example.com,de,Long-time customer,vip;loyal
+41797654321,Sophie Dubois,sophie@example.com,fr,New prospect,prospect
```

**Process:**
1. CRM ‚Üí Customers ‚Üí Upload CSV
2. System validates and reports errors with row numbers
3. Import batch tracked with success/failure counts
4. Contacts immediately available for marketing campaigns

## üö® Critical Production Notes

### Balance Sheet Safety:
**Before going live:**
1. Set `bot_max_autonomous_discount_chf` to your comfort level (default: 20 CHF)
2. Train Master admins on approval workflow
3. Monitor `bot_discount_analytics` weekly
4. Review `promotion_usage` table for abuse patterns

### Payment Security:
**Required configuration:**
1. `stripe_webhook_secret` MUST be configured (no fallback)
2. Test webhook in Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Send test webhook
3. Verify signature verification logs: "‚úÖ Webhook verified"
4. Never expose Stripe API keys in logs or frontend

### Data Integrity:
**CSV Import best practices:**
1. Validate phone number format before upload
2. Review error reports immediately
3. Delete test import batches before production
4. Use tags to track import sources
