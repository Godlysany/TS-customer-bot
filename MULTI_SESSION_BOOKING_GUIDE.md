# Multi-Session Service Booking Guide

## Overview
Many professional services require multiple sequential appointments. Your WhatsApp bot can autonomously handle complex multi-session bookings with configurable strategies, buffer times, and progress tracking.

## Why This Matters

**Traditional Booking:** Manual coordination of multiple appointments  
**Your Smart System:** Automated multi-session booking with intelligent scheduling

**Use Cases:**
- **Dentist:** 3-session dental implant (placement ‚Üí healing check ‚Üí crown installation)
- **Driving School:** 10-lesson starter package (flexible scheduling)
- **Physiotherapy:** 6-session treatment plan (weekly sessions)
- **Aesthetic Treatments:** 4-session laser hair removal (monthly intervals)
- **Personal Training:** 12-session fitness program (2x per week)

## Database Schema

### Services Table - New Fields
```sql
-- Multi-session booking configuration
requires_multiple_sessions BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
total_sessions_required INTEGER DEFAULT 1
multi_session_strategy VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'flexible'
  -- Options: 'immediate', 'sequential', 'flexible'
session_buffer_config JSONB
  -- Example: {"default_days": 7, "session_2_to_3_days": 30}
```

### Bookings Table - New Fields
```sql
-- Multi-session tracking
is_part_of_multi_session BOOLEAN DEFAULT false
session_group_id UUID  -- Links all sessions in a group
session_number INTEGER DEFAULT 1  -- 1, 2, 3, etc.
total_sessions INTEGER DEFAULT 1  -- Total sessions in group
```

## Three Booking Strategies

### 1. Immediate Strategy - Book All Upfront

**When to Use:**
- Treatment requires commitment to full sequence
- Sessions must be properly spaced
- Customer needs to plan far in advance
- Limited availability requires advance blocking

**Examples:**
- **Dental Implant:** 3 sessions over 3 months
- **Laser Treatment:** 6 sessions monthly
- **Orthodontics:** Multiple adjustment appointments

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "requires_multiple_sessions": true,
  "total_sessions_required": 3,
  "multi_session_strategy": "immediate",
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "session_1_to_2_days": 14,
    "session_2_to_3_days": 30
  }
}
```

**Bot Behavior:**
```
Bot: "The dental implant procedure requires 3 appointments:
     
     Session 1: Implant placement
     Session 2: Healing check (2 weeks later)
     Session 3: Crown installation (1 month after Session 2)
     
     Let's schedule all three now. When would you like to start?"

Customer: "How about March 1st?"

Bot: "Perfect! Here's your complete schedule:
     
     üìÖ Session 1: March 1, 2:00 PM - Implant placement
     üìÖ Session 2: March 15, 2:00 PM - Healing check
     üìÖ Session 3: April 15, 2:00 PM - Crown installation
     
     Does this work for you?"

Customer: "Yes!"

Bot: [Creates 3 bookings with session_group_id linking them all]
     "‚úÖ All 3 sessions confirmed! You'll receive reminders before each appointment."
```

**Database Result:**
```sql
-- Booking 1
session_group_id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
session_number: 1
total_sessions: 3
start_time: '2025-03-01 14:00:00'

-- Booking 2
session_group_id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
session_number: 2
total_sessions: 3
start_time: '2025-03-15 14:00:00'

-- Booking 3
session_group_id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
session_number: 3
total_sessions: 3
start_time: '2025-04-15 14:00:00'
```

### 2. Sequential Strategy - Book After Completion

**When to Use:**
- Customer needs flexibility
- Future availability uncertain
- Treatment plan may adjust based on progress
- Customer prefers not to commit to all dates

**Examples:**
- **Physiotherapy:** Book next session after seeing progress
- **Training Program:** Schedule next lesson after completing current
- **Therapy Sessions:** Book weekly as patient progresses

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "requires_multiple_sessions": true,
  "total_sessions_required": 10,
  "multi_session_strategy": "sequential",
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "minimum_days": 2,
    "maximum_days": 14
  }
}
```

**Bot Behavior:**

**First Booking:**
```
Bot: "The physiotherapy treatment plan includes 10 sessions total.
     We'll book them one at a time so you can schedule flexibly.
     
     When would you like your first session?"

Customer: "Tuesday at 4pm"

Bot: "‚úÖ Session 1 of 10 confirmed for Tuesday, March 5 at 4:00 PM.
     After you complete this session, I'll help you book Session 2."
```

**After First Session Completes:**
```
[Automatic trigger when booking status changes to 'completed']

Bot: "Great job completing Session 1! You have 9 sessions remaining.
     
     When would you like to schedule Session 2?
     (Recommended: Within the next 7 days for optimal results)"

Customer: "Friday at 4pm works"

Bot: "‚úÖ Session 2 of 10 confirmed for Friday, March 8 at 4:00 PM."
```

**Progress Tracking:**
```
After Session 5:
Bot: "Excellent! You're halfway through - 5 sessions complete, 5 to go.
     When would you like Session 6?"

After Session 10:
Bot: "üéâ Congratulations! You've completed all 10 physiotherapy sessions.
     How are you feeling? Would you like to book a follow-up evaluation?"
```

### 3. Flexible Strategy - Customer Choice

**When to Use:**
- Customer wants full control over scheduling
- No strict timing requirements
- Package/bundle service
- Customer has unpredictable availability

**Examples:**
- **Driving Lessons:** 10-lesson package, book as needed
- **Massage Package:** 5-massage bundle, schedule at own pace
- **Tutoring Sessions:** 8-session course, flexible timing

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "requires_multiple_sessions": true,
  "total_sessions_required": 10,
  "multi_session_strategy": "flexible",
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "minimum_days": 0,  // Can book consecutive days
    "suggested_frequency": "2 per week"
  }
}
```

**Bot Behavior:**
```
Bot: "The driving lesson starter package includes 10 lessons total.
     You can book as many or as few at a time as you'd like - totally flexible.
     
     How many lessons would you like to schedule now?"

Customer: "Let's do 3 to start"

Bot: "Perfect! Let's find times for your first 3 lessons.
     
     Lesson 1: When works for you?"
Customer: "Monday 5pm"

Bot: "Lesson 2: Another time?"
Customer: "Wednesday 5pm"

Bot: "Lesson 3: And one more?"
Customer: "Friday 5pm"

Bot: "‚úÖ Confirmed! Here's your schedule:
     
     üìÖ Lesson 1 of 10: Monday, March 4, 5:00 PM
     üìÖ Lesson 2 of 10: Wednesday, March 6, 5:00 PM
     üìÖ Lesson 3 of 10: Friday, March 8, 5:00 PM
     
     You have 7 lessons remaining. Book more anytime!"
```

**Later:**
```
Customer: "I want to book 2 more lessons"

Bot: "Great! You have 7 lessons remaining in your package.
     
     Let's schedule 2 more. When would you like them?"

[After booking]
Bot: "‚úÖ 2 more lessons confirmed! You've now completed 5 of 10.
     5 lessons remaining."
```

## Buffer Time Configuration

### Simple Buffer (Same Between All Sessions)
```json
{
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "default_days": 7
  }
}
```
**Behavior:** All sessions must be at least 7 days apart

### Complex Buffer (Different Between Specific Sessions)

  "session_buffer_config": {
    "session_1_to_2_days": 14,
    "session_2_to_3_days": 30,
    "session_3_to_4_days": 7
  }
}
```
**Behavior:**
- Session 1 ‚Üí Session 2: Minimum 14 days
- Session 2 ‚Üí Session 3: Minimum 30 days (healing period)
- Session 3 ‚Üí Session 4: Minimum 7 days

### Range Buffer (Min and Max)
```json
{
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "minimum_days": 2,
    "maximum_days": 14,
    "recommended_days": 7
  }
}
```
**Behavior:**
- Sessions cannot be less than 2 days apart
- Sessions should not be more than 14 days apart
- Bot suggests 7-day intervals

### No Buffer Required
```json
{
  "session_buffer_config": {
    "minimum_days": 0
  }
}
```

     treatment plan. We'll book one session at a time so we can 
     adjust based on your progress.
     
     For best results, sessions should be 2-7 days apart 
     (ideally every 3 days).
     
     When would you like your first session?"

Customer: "Tomorrow at 10am if possible"

Bot: "Checking... ‚úÖ Tomorrow (March 5) at 10:00 AM is available!

```

## Progress Tracking & Notifications

### Automatic Progress Updates

**After Each Session:**
```
"‚úÖ Session 2 of 10 complete! You have 8 sessions remaining."
```

**Halfway Point:**
```
"üéâ Milestone! You're halfway through - 5 of 10 sessions complete!"
```

**Near Completion:**
```
"Almost there! Session 9 of 10 complete. Just 1 more to go!"
```

**Completion:**
```
"üèÜ Congratulations! You've completed all 10 sessions of your treatment plan!
 
 How are you feeling? Would you like to:
 - Book a follow-up evaluation?
 - Purchase another package?
 - Share feedback on your experience?"
```

### Reminder Logic for Multi-Session

**For Immediate Strategy (All Booked):**
- Reminder 24h before each session
- Reminder includes session number: "Reminder: Session 2 of 3 tomorrow at 2pm"

**For Sequential Strategy (Book After Completion):**
- Standard reminder for current booking
- Proactive outreach after completion: "Ready to book Session 4?"
- Warning if too much time passes: "It's been 10 days since Session 3. Book Session 4 soon for best results!"

**For Flexible Strategy (Customer Paced):**
- Reminder for booked sessions
- Periodic check-ins: "You have 5 lessons remaining in your package. Would you like to schedule more?"
- Expiration warnings if applicable: "Your package expires in 30 days. 5 sessions still available!"
