# Production Readiness Gaps - Critical Analysis

## Executive Summary

While the bot configuration UI is complete and runtime validation (opening hours, service restrictions, etc.) is fully integrated, **there are 5 critical gaps** where configured settings are NOT enforced at runtime. These gaps prevent the system from being truly production-ready.

---

## ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING Features

### 1. Services Integration ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
- Services table is queried for pricing, duration, buffer times
- Multi-service booking calculates total cost and duration
- Service restrictions enforced by BookingService
- **Evidence:** `BookingService.ts` lines 61-67, `MultiServiceBookingService.ts` lines 242-272

### 2. Contact Name Management ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
- System starts with WhatsApp username
- Updates to real name when customer provides it during booking
- Prevents overwriting existing names with phone numbers
- **Evidence:** `ConversationService.ts` lines 33-45

### 3. Review Automation ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
- Review requests scheduled automatically after appointments
- ReviewService creates review entries in database
- Email sent via EmailService
- **Evidence:** `ReviewService.ts` lines 25-37, called from BookingService

### 4. Document Sharing ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE
- Automated document delivery based on service and timing
- Supports pre/post booking and pre/post appointment
- DocumentScheduler runs periodically
- Sends via WhatsApp or email based on preferences
- **Evidence:** `DocumentService.ts` lines 82-100, `DocumentScheduler.ts` lines 40-56

### 5. Runtime Configuration Validation ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETE (as of latest updates)
- Opening hours validated (both start AND end time)
- Emergency blocker slots enforced
- Service-specific time restrictions applied
- Escalation modes implemented
- GPT tone and prompts dynamic

## ‚ùå CRITICAL GAPS (Config Exists But NOT Enforced)

### 1. Email Collection Mode ‚ùå
**Status:** HALF-BAKED

**What's Configured:**
- UI exposes 3 modes: Mandatory, Gentle, Disabled
- BotConfigService loads `email_collection_mode` and prompts
- Templates exist for both modes

**What's Missing:**
- BookingChatHandler does NOT check `email_collection_mode`
- Bot does NOT enforce mandatory email collection before booking
- Bot does NOT use configured prompts
- No gentle fallback logic

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Search shows NO usage in BookingChatHandler
grep "email_collection_mode" src/core/BookingChatHandler.ts
# Returns: No matches found
```

**Impact:** CRITICAL
- User configures "mandatory email" but bot proceeds without it
- Bookings created without customer emails
- No confirmation emails sent
- Lost customer data

**Fix Required:**
1. Add email collection check in BookingChatHandler before confirming booking
2. Use configured prompts from BotConfigService
3. Implement gentle vs mandatory logic
4. Prevent booking completion if mandatory mode and no email

---

### 2. Confirmation Templates NOT Used ‚ùå
**Status:** HALF-BAKED

**What's Configured:**
- UI exposes WhatsApp and Email confirmation templates
- BotConfigService loads templates with placeholders
- Templates include: {{name}}, {{service}}, {{datetime}}, {{cost}}, {{location}}, {{directions}}, {{business_name}}

**What's Missing:**
- EmailService uses HARDCODED templates (not configured ones)
- Placeholder replacement logic NOT implemented
- User edits templates in UI but they're never used

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// src/core/EmailService.ts line 83-96
async sendBookingConfirmation(bookingId: string, contactEmail: string, bookingDetails: any): Promise<void> {
  const html = `
    <h2>Appointment Confirmed</h2>  // HARDCODED
    <p>Dear ${bookingDetails.contactName},</p>
    ...
  `;
```

**Impact:** HIGH
- User customizes templates but sees generic messages
- Branding inconsistency
- Cannot adapt to different languages/tones
- Wasted configuration effort

**Fix Required:**
1. Load confirmation templates from BotConfigService
2. Implement placeholder replacement function
3. Use configured templates in EmailService
4. Add fallback to hardcoded if template empty

---

### 3. CRM Data Extraction NOT Implemented ‚ùå
**Status:** DOCUMENTED BUT NOT CODED

**What's Documented:**
- MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md has comprehensive extraction guide (lines 147-210)
- Instructs GPT to extract:
  - Customer preferences (time slots, staff, services)
  - Fears and anxieties (dental phobia, needles, etc.)
  - Physical limitations (wheelchair, hearing, etc.)
  - Allergies and sensitivities
  - Special requests
  - Communication preferences

**What's Missing:**
- NO extraction logic in AIService
- NO saving to contact profiles
- NO structured fields in contacts table
- GPT is told to extract but has nowhere to save it

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// AIService.ts has no extractCustomerData() method
// No UPDATE queries to contacts table with preferences
// contacts table missing fields: preferences, fears, special_notes, etc.
```

**Impact:** CRITICAL
- Losing valuable customer insights from conversations
- Cannot provide personalized service
- Staff unaware of customer needs (allergies, fears, preferences)
- Missed upsell opportunities
- GDPR compliance risk (not tracking consent for data storage)

**Fix Required:**
1. Add columns to contacts table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN preferred_times TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN preferred_staff TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN fears_anxieties TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN allergies TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN special_notes TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE contacts ADD COLUMN communication_preferences JSONB;
   ```
2. Implement `extractCustomerData()` in AIService
3. Call GPT with extraction prompt after each conversation
4. Save extracted data to contact profile
5. Expose in CRM UI for staff to review

---

### 4. Questionnaires NOT Triggered ‚ùå
**Status:** HALF-BAKED

**What's Built:**
- Complete UI for building questionnaires (QuestionnaireSection.tsx)
- QuestionnaireService with all CRUD operations
- Database schema (questionnaires, questionnaire_responses tables)
- Trigger types configured (first_contact, before_booking, after_booking, service_specific)
- `generateConversationalQuestion()` method ready

**What's Missing:**
- NO runtime trigger logic
- Bot does NOT check for active questionnaires
- Bot does NOT send questions via WhatsApp
- Bot does NOT collect/save responses during conversation
- No state machine for multi-step questionnaires

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// No calls to QuestionnaireService in BookingChatHandler
// No questionnaire state in conversation context
// No WhatsApp message sending for questions
```

**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- User creates questionnaires but they never get sent
- Cannot collect customer profiling data
- Cannot link promotions to questionnaire completion
- Wasted admin effort

**Fix Required:**
1. Add questionnaire state to conversation context
2. Check for active questionnaires based on trigger type in BookingChatHandler
3. Send questions one-by-one via WhatsApp
4. Collect and validate answers
5. Save responses to questionnaire_responses table
6. Trigger linked promotions after completion
7. Handle partial completions and resumption

---

### 5. Multi-Session Booking NOT Implemented ‚ùå
**Status:** DOCUMENTED BUT NOT CODED

**What's Documented:**
- MULTI_SESSION_BOOKING_GUIDE.md exists (comprehensive guide)
- 3 strategies documented: immediate, sequential, flexible
- Buffer time configuration explained
- UI has toggle: `enable_multi_session_booking`

**What's Missing:**
- No runtime logic for chaining multiple sessions
- No buffer time enforcement between sessions
- No progress tracking
- Cannot book "package deals" (e.g., 3 physio sessions)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
- User enables feature but it doesn't work
- Cannot offer package services
- Manual workaround required

**Fix Required:**
- This is a complex 50-70 hour feature (as noted in replit.md)
- Should be communicated to user as "planned but not implemented"
