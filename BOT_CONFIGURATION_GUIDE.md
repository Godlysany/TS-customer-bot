# Comprehensive Bot Configuration Guide

## Overview
Your WhatsApp CRM Bot uses a sophisticated **two-tier prompt system** combined with comprehensive business settings to provide high-quality, context-aware customer service.

## Two-Tier Prompt Architecture

### Tier 1: Master System Prompt (Fixed - Visible but Not Editable)
The master prompt contains **core instructions** that define the bot's capabilities and responsibilities. This ensures the bot always knows its duties regardless of business customization.

**What it includes:**
- Appointment booking duties and flow
- Questionnaire administration
- Promotion management
- Sentiment analysis rules
- Escalation triggers and logic
- Multi-language support
- Data collection guidelines
- Technical instructions for confirmations
- Error handling procedures

**Placeholders replaced dynamically:**
- `{BUSINESS_NAME}` - Your business name
- `{BUSINESS_LOCATION}` - Your physical address
- `{DIRECTIONS_TO_LOCATION}` - How to reach you
- `{OPENING_HOURS}` - Your operating hours
- `{AVAILABLE_SERVICES}` - List of services from database
- `{SERVICE_TRIGGER_WORDS}` - Keywords mapped to each service
- `{SERVICE_RESTRICTIONS}` - Time/day restrictions per service
- `{EMAIL_REQUIREMENT_INSTRUCTION}` - How to collect emails
- `{EMAIL_COLLECTION_INSTRUCTION}` - Mandatory vs gentle approach
- `{ESCALATION_TRIGGERS}` - Keywords that escalate to human
- `{WHATSAPP_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE}` - WhatsApp message format
- `{EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE}` - Email message format
- `{BUSINESS_FINE_TUNING_PROMPT}` - Your custom tier 2 prompt

**Why it's fixed:**
Ensures the bot always understands its core responsibilities (booking, sentiment tracking, escalation, etc.) and never loses critical functionality during customization.

### Tier 2: Business Fine-Tuning Prompt (Editable with Defaults)
This is YOUR space to customize the bot's personality, tone, and business-specific nuances.

**Default Example:**
```
We are a professional service provider focused on quality and customer satisfaction. 
Maintain a friendly yet professional tone. Show empathy and patience with all customers.
Use clear, concise language. Always confirm customer understanding before proceeding with bookings.
If a customer seems uncertain, offer to explain options in more detail.
```

**What you can customize:**
- Tone of voice (formal, casual, warm, energetic)
- Brand personality traits
- Specific phrases or terminology you use
- How to handle special customer types
- Cultural considerations
- Level of emoji usage
- Response length preferences

**Best Practices:**
- Keep it concise (2-4 sentences)
- Focus on tone and style, not tasks (tasks are in master prompt)
- Use examples if helpful
- Update seasonally if needed

## Business Information Settings

### 1. Business Name
**Purpose:** Displayed to customers, used in confirmations and signatures  
**Example:** `"Swiss Wellness Center"`  
**Used in:** All customer-facing messages

### 2. Business Location
**Purpose:** Physical address where appointments take place  
**Example:** `"Bahnhofstrasse 123, 8001 Z√ºrich, Switzerland"`  
**Used in:** Booking confirmations, when customers ask for location

### 3. Directions (Anfahrtsbeschreibung)
**Purpose:** How to reach your business  
**Example:**
```
From Z√ºrich HB: Take Tram 6 towards Zoo, exit at Paradeplatz (3 stops). 
Walk 200m north on Bahnhofstrasse. We are in the building with the blue awning.
Parking: Public parking available at Parking Jelmoli (5 min walk).
```
**Used in:** Booking confirmations, when customers ask how to reach you

### 4. Opening Hours
**Format:** JSON object with hours per day  
**Example:**
```json
{
  "monday": "09:00-18:00",
  "tuesday": "09:00-18:00",
  "wednesday": "09:00-18:00",
  "thursday": "09:00-20:00",
  "friday": "09:00-18:00",
  "saturday": "10:00-14:00",
  "sunday": "closed"
}
```
**Used in:** Bot knows when to offer slots, rejects out-of-hours requests

---

## Service-Specific Configuration

For each service in your Services Management:

### Trigger Words
**Purpose:** Keywords the bot recognizes to identify this service  
**Format:** JSON array of strings  
**Example for "Deep Tissue Massage":**
```json
["massage", "deep tissue", "muscle pain", "tension", "sports massage", "therapy"]
```

**How it works:**
- Customer says: "I need a massage for my back pain"
- Bot matches: "massage" ‚Üí Deep Tissue Massage service
- Bot confirms: "Great! I can book you for a Deep Tissue Massage..."

### Booking Time Restrictions
**Purpose:** Limit when this specific service can be booked  
**Format:** JSON object  
**Example:**
```json
{
  "days": ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"],
  "hours": "09:00-17:00"
}
```
This service is only bookable Monday-Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM (even if business opens later other days).

**Common Use Cases:**
- Specialist only works certain days
- Equipment only available certain hours
- Longer treatments need full day slots
- Weekend-only services

---

## Emergency/Blocker Slots

**Purpose:** Times when the bot should NEVER book appointments  
**Use Cases:**
- Staff meetings
- Equipment maintenance
- Emergency procedures
- Personal time off
- Training sessions

**How to Configure:**
Via the Bookings/Calendar management interface:
1. Create blocker slot with title and time range
2. Mark as "Recurring" if it repeats weekly
3. Bot automatically excludes these times from availability

**Example Blocker:**
```
Title: "Weekly Team Meeting"
Time: Every Monday 08:00-09:00
Recurring: Yes
```

---

## Email Collection Settings

### Mandatory vs Gentle Mode

**booking_email_mandatory: false (Gentle Mode - Recommended)**
Bot behavior:
1. Asks for email: "May I have your email address for the confirmation?"
2. If customer provides: Great! Sends email confirmation
3. If customer ignores/declines: Proceeds with booking anyway
4. Still asks, but doesn't block the booking

**booking_email_mandatory: true (Mandatory Mode)**
Bot behavior:
1. Asks for email: "I'll need your email address to confirm this booking."
2. If customer provides: Great! Proceeds with booking
3. If customer ignores/declines: "I'm sorry, we require an email address to complete bookings. This helps us send you confirmation and important updates."
4. Repeats until email is provided or customer abandons

**Recommendation:** Start with gentle mode. Customers prefer optionality.

- Use "closed" for non-operating days
- Support lunch breaks: "09:00-12:00,14:00-18:00"
