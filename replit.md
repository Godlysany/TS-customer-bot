# WhatsApp CRM Bot

## Overview
This project is a professional B2B customer service platform integrating WhatsApp for communication, Supabase as its database, and OpenAI GPT for intelligent replies. It aims to provide a self-contained, scalable solution for customer service operations through comprehensive control over customer interactions, intelligent automation, and deep insights. Key capabilities include a robust CRM, calendar booking, advanced customer analytics, and marketing features. The system focuses on transforming customer service by offering intelligent automation and in-depth insights into customer interactions.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The system utilizes a modular TypeScript architecture based on Node.js (v20+). It separates concerns into `adapters` (external services), `api` (REST endpoints), `core` (business logic), and `infrastructure` (configuration, clients).

### UI/UX Decisions
The Admin CRM Frontend is developed using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. It features a professional dashboard with five main navigation pages: conversations, settings, customer analytics, marketing campaigns, and bookings. A TypeScript API client with React Query hooks ensures type-safe interactions.

### Technical Implementations & Features
- **Comprehensive Bot Configuration System (October 21, 2025)**: Two-tier prompt architecture with Master System Prompt (fixed, comprehensive core instructions) and Business Fine-Tuning Prompt (editable personality/tone customization). Includes 15+ business settings (name, location, directions, opening hours), confirmation templates with dynamic placeholders (WhatsApp/Email), service-specific trigger words and time restrictions, emergency blocker slots table, escalation keyword configuration, flexible email collection modes (mandatory/gentle), and complete documentation in MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md and BOT_CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md. Database schema production-ready; runtime implementation in AIService and BookingChatHandler pending.
- **Direct GPT Integration**: Configurable OpenAI API key and prompt orchestration for intelligent replies.
- **Supabase CRM**: Stores conversation history, customer data, and manages escalations using a PostgreSQL database.
- **Booking System**: Integrates with Google iCal (extensible), handles penalty fee calculation, waitlist management, and sends email notifications via SendGrid with automated reminders.
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Uses Baileys for WhatsApp Web API, featuring message debouncing, bot on/off toggles, connection status tracking, manual takeover modes (pause_bot, write_between, full_control), and a QR code modal for easy connection. Includes auto-reconnect and connection monitoring.
- **Customer Analytics**: Tracks sentiment, keywords, upsell potential, and engagement.

- **Settings Page**: Centralized management for WhatsApp connection, API keys (OpenAI, Deepgram, SendGrid, ElevenLabs), calendar settings, secretary email, daily summary time, cancellation policies, and bot toggles.
- **Message Pre-Approval System**: Prevents race conditions and ensures idempotency for sending messages, with a "sending" status to manage atomic approvals.
- **No-Show Protection**: Automated detection and penalty system for no-shows, including a strike system and configurable suspension.
