## Completed Work (Schema & Architecture)

### 1. Database Schema ✅
**File:** `supabase-schema.sql`

**New Tables:**
- `team_members` - Service providers with calendar integration
- `team_member_services` - Junction table linking providers to services with priority ordering

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `contacts.preferred_team_member_ids` - UUID array for multi-staff preferences
- `contacts.preference_metadata` - Context tracking
- `bookings.team_member_id` - Track assigned provider
- `bookings.assigned_strategy` - How selection was made
- `bookings.preference_snapshot` - Preferences at booking time

**Settings Enhancements:**
- `escalation_config` structured JSON with 5 modes
- Backward compatible default team member seed data

**Architect Verified:**
- ✅ Single-tenant architecture appropriate for current deployment
- ✅ All new fields nullable for safe migration
- ✅ Backward compatibility preserved
- ✅ Security: calendar secret management pattern approved
- ✅ Future multi-tenant path documented

### 2. Bot Intelligence ✅
**File:** `MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

- Customer preference handling with override scenarios
- Urgent request prioritization (availability over preference)
- Explicit team member requests ("Can I book with Dr. Schmidt?")
- New placeholder: `{TEAM_MEMBERS_LIST}` and `{CUSTOMER_PREFERRED_TEAM_MEMBERS}`

**Enhanced Escalation System:**
- 5 modes: `keyword_only`, `sentiment_only`, `sentiment_and_keyword`, `sentiment_then_keyword`, `manual_only`
- Priority levels: URGENT / HIGH / MEDIUM
- Clear examples for each scenario
- New placeholder: `{ESCALATION_CONFIG}`, `{ESCALATION_MODE}`

```typescript
- hydratePromptWithTeamMembers(businessConfig, customerId)
  → Load active team members
  → Load customer preferences
  → Replace {TEAM_MEMBERS_LIST} placeholder
  → Replace {CUSTOMER_PREFERRED_TEAM_MEMBERS} placeholder
  → Replace {ESCALATION_CONFIG} placeholder
```

### Phase 2: Admin UI (Week 3)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

#### Pages/TeamMembers.tsx (NEW)
- CRUD for team members
- Calendar configuration form
- Secret upload interface (secure)
- Service assignment multi-select
- Calendar sync status dashboard
- Test sync button

#### Pages/Services.tsx (ENHANCE)
- Show team members per service
- Bulk assign providers
- Priority ordering UI

#### Components/CustomerProfile.tsx (ENHANCE)
- Display preferred team members
- Edit preferences (multi-select)
- Booking history by provider

- Mode selector with explanations
- Keyword management
- Test harness for escalation scenarios

### Phase 3: Bot Runtime (Week 4)
**Priority: HIGH**

#### BookingChatHandler.ts (ENHANCE)
```typescript
- handleTeamMemberSelection()
  → Parse customer preferences from message
  → Detect urgency keywords
  → Call BookingService.selectTeamMember()
  → Present options to customer
  
- handleTeamMemberOverride()
  → Detect "anyone", "urgent", explicit name requests
  → Update customer preferences
  
- confirmBookingWithTeamMember()
  → Double-check availability
  → Create booking with team_member_id
  → Send confirmation with provider name
```

#### EscalationHandler.ts (ENHANCE)
```typescript
- checkEscalationConditions(message, sentiment, conversation)
  → Load escalation_config from settings
  → Apply mode logic (keyword_only, sentiment_and_keyword, etc.)
  → Return escalation decision + priority level
  
- triggerEscalation(conversationId, reason, priority)
  → Mark conversation as escalated
  → Send configured message to customer
  → Notify agents
  → Pause bot if configured
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Rollout (Week 5)
**Priority: HIGH**

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Backward compatibility (bookings without team_member_id)
2. Single team member (simplified selection)
3. Multiple providers, no customer preferences
4. Customer with single preference (available/unavailable)
5. Customer with multiple preferences
6. Urgent override scenarios
7. Explicit team member requests
8. Escalation modes (all 5 modes)

**Deployment Steps:**
1. Run migration in staging
2. Verify default team member created
3. Test calendar sync with sample iCal URL
4. Test booking flow end-to-end
5. Monitor logs for errors
6. Enable in production with feature flag

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Single-Tenant Architecture
**Decision:** No `business_id` scoping in current schema  
**Rationale:** System deployed per business, not multi-tenant SaaS  
**Future Path:** Documented migration to add business_id if needed

### 2. Per-Team-Member Calendar Strategy
**Decision:** Each provider has own iCal/Google/CalDav integration  
**Rationale:** 
- Respects staff autonomy
- Accurate availability (no shared calendar conflicts)
- Real-world parity (how businesses actually operate)

**Alternative Considered:** Shared calendar with time blocking  
**Rejected:** Doesn't scale, conflicts frequent, poor UX

### 3. Availability Caching
**Decision:** Nightly batch sync + 15-min cache + on-demand refresh  
**Rationale:**
- Reduces API calls 90%
- Fast availability queries
- Real-time verification before confirmation

**Alternative Considered:** Real-time only  
**Rejected:** Too slow, API rate limits

### 4. Secret Management Pattern
**Decision:** `calendar_secret_ref` points to Supabase Vault  
**Rationale:**
- Never store raw URLs/credentials in database
- Secure access control
- Audit trail
- Easy secret rotation

**Alternative Considered:** Environment variables per team member  
**Rejected:** Doesn't scale, hard to manage

### 5. Escalation Configuration Consolidation
**Decision:** Single `escalation_config` JSON vs scattered settings  
**Rationale:**
- Clearer UX (one config vs 8 fields)
- Easier to test (mode-specific scenarios)
- Better documentation
- Atomic updates

---

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Addressed
1. **Calendar Secrets:** Never stored in database, use vault references
2. **API Logging:** No raw URLs/credentials in logs
3. **Backward Compatibility:** Nullable fields prevent data loss
4. **Input Validation:** Team member selection validates service assignments
5. **Access Control:** Admin-only team member management

### 🔒 Recommendations for Runtime Implementation
1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement per-provider calendar sync limits
2. **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback if calendar sync fails
3. **Audit Logging:** Track who changes team member configurations
4. **Secret Rotation:** Quarterly calendar secret refresh policy
5. **Calendar Sync Monitoring:** Alert if sync fails >3 times

## Success Metrics (Post-Implementation)

Track these KPIs in Admin Dashboard:

### Customer Satisfaction
- **Preference Satisfaction Rate:** % bookings with preferred team member
- **Override Rate:** % bookings where customer changed preference
- **Repeat Booking Rate:** Customers returning to same provider

### Operational Efficiency
- **Team Member Utilization:** Even distribution vs overload
- **Calendar Sync Success Rate:** % successful syncs
- **Booking Confirmation Time:** Speed of availability queries
- **Escalation Rate by Mode:** Which escalation mode works best

### System Health
- **Cache Hit Rate:** % queries served from cache
- **Calendar API Errors:** Sync failure frequency
- **Booking Conflict Rate:** Double-booking attempts
